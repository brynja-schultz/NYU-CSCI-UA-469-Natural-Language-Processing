# Natural Language Processing (Python)

New York University – College of Arts and Science

## Course Context

This repository contains my programming assignments from **Natural Language Processing (CSCI-UA 469)** at NYU, Fall 2024. The course explored fundamental NLP tasks and algorithms, bridging linguistics and computer science with hands-on coding exercises and applied projects.

**Tech Stack**: Python · NumPy · scikit-learn · NLTK · Regex · Standard Libraries

## Project Highlights

* **Assignment 1 – Adjective Annotation**: Manual annotation of adjectives in XML format.
* **Assignment 2 – Regular Expressions**: Extracting structured data (telephone numbers, dollar amounts) using regex.
* **Assignment 3 – POS Tagging (HMM + Viterbi)**: Implementing a hidden Markov model and Viterbi algorithm for part-of-speech tagging.
* **Assignment 4 – Information Retrieval**: Building a small-scale search system with indexing and retrieval.
* **Assignment 5 – Sequence Labeling (Noun Groups)**: Feature engineering and sequence labeling for noun phrase chunking.
* **Short Homework 1–3**: Focused exercises reinforcing core NLP techniques.
* **Final Project**: [Evaluating Large Language Models for Legal Q&A](https://github.com/rachelren2025/NLP_Final_Project.git) — applied NLP project showcasing model implementation and evaluation.

## Skills Developed

* Applying **regular expressions** for text cleaning and information extraction.
* Implementing **HMMs and Viterbi decoding** for sequence modeling.
* Designing **information retrieval pipelines** (tokenization, indexing, search).
* Feature engineering and **sequence labeling** for chunking tasks.
* Strengthening problem-solving in **linguistics + machine learning intersections**.
